i learned basic programming skills with javascript, css and html by realizing this mockup-experiment. this small application can handle 3d-models in the format collada, which is depricated today for the web i think. the structure of collada is nice to read but with low performance, as you can see. when i had the idea for a business called https://cadgui.de 10 years ago, my web-experiences were written in html. my learning curve fired when i realized the differences between static and dynamic sites. the mockup is dynamic because there is only a little bit of a html-backbone. the displayed content depends on functions, which are written in js of course. the design is realized with css. css and js are most important.

90% of the time i created designs of the user-interface. and man that's a never ending story. a perfect illustrator-graphic of an ui can hardly transformed into a web-design with css. there are challenges. the hardest is the time. css-programming is so time intensive and frustrating. the graphic of an ui transformed into css will looking different in safari and chrome. give up control and perfection is a skill. the backbone is for localhost usecaes with the logic for a dynamic one-pager. the navigation between the public view and the private view is realized and the hard coded commentation functionality too. the mockup is free from helper frameworks. everything is handmade ;)
