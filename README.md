i learned basic programming skills with javascript, css and html by realizing this mockup-experiment. and i learn, that i will never be a software-developer. this small app can handle 3d-models in the format collada, which is depricated today for the web i think. the structure of collada is nice to read but with low performance, as you can see. when i had the idea for a business called https://cadgui.de 10 years ago, my web-experiences were written in html. my learning curve fired when i realized the differences between static and dynamic sites. the mockup is dynamic because there is only a little bit of a html-backbone. the displayed content depends on functions, which are written in js of course. the design is realized with css. css and js are the main development objects.
